## ✅Introduction✅
Hello, 
my name is Abhijeet Sitaram Patil, and I am From Wardha Maharashtra. 
And I have completed my graduation in bacholers of engineering, from BDCOE Sewagram in 2020.
And i have 3 years of experiance in S7Digital Organisations as a Cloud Engineer (Linux System Admin)
where I was responsible for maintaining and managing Linux-based systems On Cloud services. 
And I’ve developed strong hands-on skills in AWS in setting up IAM, EC2, VPC, S3, RDS, EKS and CloudWatch for the monitoring. 
I’ve also explored DevOps tools like Git, GitHub, Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform. 
I've implemented CI/CD pipelines, deployed microservices, and worked on EKS cluster setup and monitoring. 
I’m comfortable working under pressure, enjoy problem-solving, and always look for new opportunities to learn and take on new challenges.
I’m now looking to grow in a dynamic DevOps or cloud-focused role where I can contribute with my existing skills”.
